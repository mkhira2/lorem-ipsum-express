# Lorem Ipsum Express

Created an Express app that responds on the URL /lorem by returning three paragraphs of text in HTML format generated by the lorem-ipsum package.

Added the ability to accept URLs with the structure /lorem/[number-of-paragraphs], where [number-of-paragraphs] is a positive integer that determines how many paragraphs of lorem ipsum text to generate.
